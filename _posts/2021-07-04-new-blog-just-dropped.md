Lately I've honestly started to feel it's quite a waste and effort throwing impressions and reccomendations into the void twitter.
So instead I've decided to dive back in time and set up this thing called a blog where I can toss stuff into with the added benefit of still actually being able to find stuff back after a few days pass.
Also its honestly kind of fun to actually be able to freely customize stuff again instead of having to pay for things like having tiny banners.

In any case, I'm mainly planning on using this space to post about LNs a lot (and the occasional game). My tastes have gotten pretty niche so I'll be pretty happy if this manages to reach somebody with tastes similar one day.
